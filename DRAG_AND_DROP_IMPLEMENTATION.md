- Automatically assigned sequential positions to existing items

### 2. Backend Updates
- Created `useMoveItem` hook for handling item moves between columns
- Updated `useCreateItem` to assign positions to new items
- Added optimistic updates for instant UI feedback

### 3. Frontend Components
- Created `DraggableRetroItem` wrapper component with drag handle
- Integrated DndContext in `RetrospectiveBoard`
- Added SortableContext for each column
- Implemented drag overlay for visual feedback during drag

### 4. Features Implemented

   - Reorder items within a column
4. On mobile devices:
   - Long press (250ms) to initiate drag

## Technical Details

### Drag Sensors
